I am excited to present this deployed web application for Challenge 2 which meets all of the acceptance criterea.

The site contains a nav bar with working links that connect to three areas, "Home," "About," and "Gallery" on the index.html page and one external page called "Contact." The contact page only has HTML and CSS at the moment and has not yet been properly set up for email. I will set this up in the near future.

The site has a "Home" section, where I give a greeting to the viewer, an "About" section, where I give a brief synopsis of my journey as a software engineer, and a "Gallery" section, which contains one of my deployed web applications along with place-holder images that link to my GitHub profile.

I hope you enjoy this web apllication and look forward to receiving feedback on how I can make improvements.

Thank you,

Jade Haney
