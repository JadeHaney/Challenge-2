        <h2>About Jade</h2>
        <p>
          My interest in web development was first sparked while working as the
          Digital Content Manager for a non-profit, where I was introduced to
          HTML and PHP when drafting weekly newsletters, and blogs, and updating
          graphics and information the organization's website. But, I officially
          started my journey to becoming a software engineer two years ago when
          I dove head-first into learning HTML and CSS through courses on Udemy
          and YouTube. After a couple of months of going the self-taught rout, I
          realized that I needed more than what I was learning on my own. So,
          enrolled in the Thinkful Web Developer Bootcamp, where I learned the
          basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git, and graduated with a
          Front-End Web Developer Certificate.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently enrolled in a Bootcamp at the University of Minnesota
          and am working on filling my portfolio with various web applications
          while working towards becoming a Full-Stack Software Engineer. In my
          spare time, I have been working on a portfolio using HTML, CSS, and
          Javascript. Though it currently has placeholder images and links, I
          will soon be replacing them with fully deployed web applications
          created by me. This portfolio is linked below under "Witty
          Productions". If you are interested in having a custom site created
          that suits your business needs, please feel free to contact me.
